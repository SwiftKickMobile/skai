# Safe Operations (Agent Policy)

This policy applies to agents executing the `skai` workflows, including install/update runbooks.

## Rules

- Do not change code without explicit authorization when in discussion/troubleshooting mode.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Do not push unless explicitly asked.
- Do not delete project files unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add dependencies unless explicitly asked.
- Do not revert changes unless explicitly asked.
- Hard prohibition: do not run destructive/irreversible operations unless the human explicitly approves that specific operation. If unsure, STOP and ask.
- `auto` never bypasses this rule.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes.
- Before overwriting anything, determine whether the file is managed vs project-owned.
  - Managed files are identified by the managed header.
  - Project-owned files must not be overwritten.

## Explicit approval requirement (destructive operations)

"Explicit approval" means the human clearly instructs you to run the specific destructive operation now (an imperative request), not merely to discuss options or describe what the command would do.

If the user intent is ambiguous, treat it as NOT approved and STOP to ask: "Do you want me to run <exact command>?"

Examples:

- Approved:
  - "Run `git reset --hard`."
  - "Discard those changes. Go ahead and run `git restore -- path/to/file`."
  - "Force push this branch with `git push --force-with-lease`."
- Not approved:
  - "Should we reset?"
  - "Can you clean this up?"
  - "What does `git clean -fd` do?"
  - "We might need to force push."

## Destructive operations (examples; not exhaustive)

Destructive operations are actions that discard work, destroy data, or are difficult to reverse.

Before running a destructive operation:
- Describe what will be affected (scope).
- Describe what could be lost.
- Ask for explicit approval, then STOP and wait.

Examples (git):
- Discarding changes (e.g., `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore -- <path>`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `git clean -fdx`)
- Deleting branches or tags (e.g., `git branch -D`, `git tag -d`)
- Force pushing (e.g., `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`)
- Dropping stashes (e.g., `git stash drop`, `git stash clear`)
- History rewrite or branch-pointer moves (e.g., `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git reset --soft|--mixed|--hard`)

Examples (filesystem / data):
- Deleting files or directories (e.g., `rm`, `rm -rf`, deleting/overwriting a non-managed file)
- Data resets (e.g., dropping a database, wiping a local app data directory)
- Bulk rewrites without a clean recovery plan (e.g., mass search/replace across the repo)
