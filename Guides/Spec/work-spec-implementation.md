# Work Task Development Rules

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE - READ FIRST 🚨

**NEVER check the box on the current task in the work spec document.**
- You can check the box (`- [x]`) on the PREVIOUS task when starting a new task — but only after advance intent.
- You NEVER check the box on the CURRENT task while implementation is in progress.
- Task completion (`- [x]`) happens at the planned gate after the human asks for the next task.

## Gates

Core rule: every time the agent is waiting on the human, the message must end with a `⏳ GATE:` line. The only normal exception is full workflow completion, which uses `🏁 Complete. Let me know if anything needs adjustment.`

**Gate persistence.** Once a `⏳ GATE:` line is emitted, every subsequent response — including discussion, clarifications, and refinements — must end with the *same* gate line, verbatim, until the gate actually moves. The gate stays "on" between turns; re-emitting it is mandatory, not optional. Update the line only when the gate's content actually changes (e.g., a blocker emerges, or `Next` has to be revised); when updating, emit the new line in full at the end of that response. Do not paraphrase, shorten, or silently mutate the line across turns.

**No fabricated gates.** `⏳ GATE:` lines only appear at gates this `## Gates` section defines or at a properly emitted blocked gate. Do not invent new gate categories or labels to describe discussion state, partial completion, or intermediate review. If a `⏳ GATE:` line is needed that this guide doesn't define, that's a signal the guide is missing a gate — file it as a process improvement.

Use these standard gate lines:
- Planned gate: `⏳ GATE: Next: <what happens after your response>. Say "next" or what to change.`
- Blocked gate: `⏳ GATE: Blocked: <reason>. Resolve and say "next" to continue.`

Planned gates are the expected review points of this workflow. At each planned gate:
1. Summarize what you finished and what should happen next.
2. End with the planned gate line.
3. STOP and wait for the human.

In the planned gate line, `<what happens after your response>` should describe what the agent will do after the human gives advance intent.

If an unexpected blocker prevents continued work, use the blocked gate line and STOP until the human resolves it.

Planned gates for this workflow:
- After completing the implementation work for Task N, but before checking Task N's box and starting Task N+1.
- At the end of `next auto`, if work remains or the run stopped early, to report what was completed vs what remains (and why).

---

## Advance intent

Advance intent moves past the current gate. Common signals: "next", "continue", "go ahead", "do it".

Rules:
- Recognized as approval to move past a gate only after you output a `⏳ GATE:` line.
- "we should...", "let's..." = discussion/context-setting, NOT authorization.
- Outside a gate, interpret "begin"/"next"/"continue" using the active-task rules below. Do not use them to check the current task box early.

`auto` = advance intent that bypasses planned gates only. Blocked gates always require explicit human resolution.
`auto to <target>` = auto-advance but STOP before the named workflow target. Use stable task identifiers (e.g., `T7`, `task 7`).

Progress tracking:
- Default marker convention: `- [ ]` / `- [x]` in the work spec (a process artifact). See `Guides/Core/process-flow.md`, "Progress markers".
- Default rule: a `- [ ]` task item means TODO or pending approval. Do not check the box without human approval.
- In this workflow, the current task's `- [ ]` marker is the task gate/phase marker.
- When Task N implementation work finishes, STOP at the planned gate with Task N still `- [ ]`.
- Only after the human gives advance intent may the agent check Task N (`- [x]`), check any fully satisfied work-spec-only inventory items completed by Task N, and begin Task N+1.
- If work stops due to a blocker, do not check the current task's box.

**Behavior:** Context determines the action:
- If waiting to proceed → mark previous task complete (if applicable) and begin next task
- If stopped due to ambiguities or unexpected challenges → resume implementation where you left off

**When executing next task:**
1. Find the first unchecked task (`- [ ]`) in the work spec.
2. **If not the first task:**
   - Check the box (`- [x]`) on the previous (just-completed) task.
   - Check the box on any Requirements Inventory items in the *work spec only* that were fully satisfied by the completed task.
   - Check the box on any API Inventory items fully implemented by the completed task.
3. Implement the next task in sequence (referring to requirement IDs for full context).
4. Follow the Task N implementation rules below.

**Workflow-specific `auto` rules:**

- Automatically implements all remaining `- [ ]` tasks in sequence, checking each completed task as auto advances.
- If auto completes the final remaining task with no blocker and no bounded target stop, check that final task's box and complete the workflow with `🏁 Complete...` rather than stopping at a planned gate.
- `auto to <target>` should use stable task identifiers (for example, `T7`).
- If auto stops early because work remains, report progress at the planned gate (tasks completed vs tasks remaining `- [ ]`).

**Auto-fixes allowed:**
- Obvious typos (wrong variable names, enum values)
- Missing imports
- Simple compilation errors
- Minor API mismatches between spec and implementation

**Never auto-fix (always stop and ask):**
- Removing, weakening, or changing any requirement in the work spec
- Changing the architectural approach (e.g., predicate-based filtering → in-memory filtering)
- Dropping indexes, constraints, or schema elements the spec called for
- Any change where the spec said X and you are implementing not-X

**Bright-line test:** If your fix requires editing the work spec to remove or weaken a requirement or design decision, STOP. That is a spec deviation, not a fix -- it requires human input regardless of how obvious the alternative seems.

**Workflow-specific STOP notes:** In this workflow, common blocked cases include:
- A required build/test/verification tool or integration is missing or broken
- Project configuration or environment problems prevent correct implementation or verification
- The work spec says X but the next viable implementation step would do not-X
- Required verification evidence cannot be produced, or new evidence contradicts the current task/spec

For any of these, STOP with the blocked gate line and leave the current task as `- [ ]`.

## Task N Implementation

When implementing Task N:

### Step 1: Mark Previous Task Complete (if applicable)
- **IF** there is a previous unchecked task: Check the box (`- [x]`) on it in the work spec.
- **IF** implementing the first task: Skip this step (no previous task exists).
- **Update Requirements Inventory (work spec only)**: Check the box on any `- [ ]` requirements in the work spec inventory (e.g., `DATA-01`, `MIG-02`, `TEMP-01`) that were fully satisfied by the completed task.
- **Update API Inventory**: Check the box on any `- [ ]` APIs that were fully implemented by the completed task.

**Important:**
- Do NOT add or modify any progress markers in the canonical requirements repository (`/requirements/**`).
- Canonical requirements are referenced by ID only and never carry progress state.
- All execution and progress tracking lives exclusively in the work spec.

### Step 2: Implement Current Task
- Read the task requirements carefully
- Treat the task's **"Done when:"** line (if present) as the stable completion criteria for the task.
- **Refer to the Requirements Inventory**: Each subtask cites requirement IDs (e.g., `DOC-01`, `VALID-02`). Use these to find the full requirement text and ensure the implementation satisfies it.
- Implement all code changes needed
- Run verification subtasks and capture evidence:
  - Use project-specific commands/paths from `skai/integration.md` (do not invent commands).
  - Record evidence inline on the verification subtask line using an evidence bracket.
    - Format: `[evidence: <command variant>; exit <code>; output: <optional link(s)>]`
    - On failure: persist full output to a file under `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<spec-name>/work-spec/evidence/` (or the workflow-specific location if one exists) and link it.
    - On success: linked output is optional; still record command variant and exit code.
- If implementation differs from the spec (spec deviation):
  - STOP and propose a spec amendment (exact text change) for approval.
  - Only after approval: update the work spec, then proceed.
  - Never silently edit the spec after the fact to justify an already-made deviation.
  - End with the blocked gate line.

### Step 2.5: Stop on Ambiguity
If you encounter ambiguity, incompleteness, or potential errors in the spec during implementation:
- **STOP immediately** and ask the human for clarification
- Do NOT guess or make assumptions about the intended behavior
- Do NOT continue implementing with a flawed understanding
- Explain the ambiguity clearly and propose options if applicable
- Wait for the human to resolve the ambiguity
- End with the blocked gate line.

### Step 3: Stop and Wait
- **DO NOT** check the box on Task N in the work spec.
- **DO NOT** proceed to the next task.
- **DO NOT** update current task status.
- End with the planned gate line.
- If there is another task after Task N, the `Next` text should say you will check the box on Task N and begin Task N+1 after advance intent.
- If Task N is the final task, the `Next` text should say you will check the box on Task N and complete the workflow after advance intent.

### Step 4: During Implementation
- When asked questions, do not make changes unless explicitly instructed
- Focus only on the current task requirements

## 📋 Summary Checklist

For each task implementation:
- Check the box on the previous task (if applicable).
- Check the box on completed requirements in Requirements Inventory.
- Check the box on completed APIs in API Inventory.
- Refer to requirement IDs during implementation to ensure full coverage.
- Implement current task fully.
- Update work spec if implementation changed from plan.
- Stop and wait.
- ❌ DO NOT check the box on the current task.

### Why This Rule Exists
The human controls task progression. Checking the current task's box would signal the work is finished and reviewed, which only the human can determine.

## Unit Testing Tasks

When a task involves implementing unit tests, follow the **Unit Testing Guide** (`Guides/Test/unit-testing-guide.md`) as a mandatory sub-process.

**Integration with task workflow:**
1. The work spec task defines *what* to test (e.g., "Write unit tests for TemplateRenderer")
2. The unit testing guide defines *how* to test (planning, infrastructure, writing phases)
3. When the unit testing sub-process completes, return to the work spec workflow

**Task completion criteria:**
- All test files planned and approved.
- All sections implemented (no 🟡 remaining in test files — the in-code progress markers from the unit-test planning workflow have all been removed as tests are written and pass).
- Work spec task can be marked complete (`- [x]`).

**Do NOT:**
- Skip the planning phase
- Deviate from the unit testing guide process without approval
- Mark the work spec task complete until all testing is done
