# Debugging / Problem-Resolution Guide (Core)

Goal: prevent "guessing fixes" loops by using evidence, clear tactics, and explicit stopping conditions.

## Checkpoints

This guide follows the shared process-flow mechanics in `Guides/Core/process-flow.md` (checkpoints, advance intent, `auto`, and the standard gate line).

Workflow-specific gate points (this guide must STOP and wait at these checkpoints):
- Before running an experiment (pre-experiment): present facts + possibility-space partition (2-4) + chosen tactic + proposed discriminating experiment for approval.
- After an experiment (post-experiment): present results + conclusions + updated possibility space + recommended next experiment for approval.
- Before declaring a root cause (root cause): present the root cause statement and why it cannot be further partitioned for approval.
- Before applying a fix (fix): present the proposed fix (or fix options) and the expected evidence of success for approval.
- Before concluding (verify/close): present verification results plus any log cleanup/undo of experiment scaffolding for approval to conclude.

## Required mindset

- **Facts over speculation**: conclusions must be backed by observable evidence.
- **Hypotheses guide experiments**: use hypotheses to decide what to measure, not as conclusions.
- **One change per experiment**: avoid bundling multiple changes that confuse causality.

## Human-in-the-loop contract

In most projects the agent cannot run the app or observe runtime behavior directly.

- The **agent** proposes the smallest next experiment and explains what it will prove/disprove.
- The **human** runs the experiment and provides outputs (logs, test output, screenshots, traces, crash reports).

## Pick a tactic, justify it, reassess

For each iteration:
1. State the current best explanation space (2-4 possibilities).
2. Pick a tactic and justify why it's the best next step.
3. Design the smallest discriminating experiment.
4. Run (human) → report evidence → update the possibility space.
5. If the tactic isn't producing new discriminating evidence quickly, switch tactics.

Checkpoint: STOP for approval before proceeding to the next iteration (use the standard gate line; see `Guides/Core/process-flow.md`). The human may use `auto` to bypass iteration checkpoints, but `auto` does not bypass universal STOP conditions or the hard gates below.

## Debugging toolbox (core)

- **Facts-first logging/instrumentation**
  - Purpose: produce evidence that eliminates possibilities (not "log everything").
  - Log at:
    - decision points (branches, retries, state changes)
    - function/module boundaries (inputs + outputs)
    - sequencing points (start/end markers, ordering)
    - identity/lifecycle points (object instance identity when relevant)
  - Log format:
    - use `AIDEV:` as the debug log prefix unless explicitly overridden
    - include key values needed to differentiate paths
  - Workflow:
    1. write a hypothesis
    2. add the smallest log(s) that will confirm/refute it
    3. have the human run and paste the output
    4. state *facts* from the output (no "probably/maybe")

- **Partition the possibility space**
  - Example structure: A/B/C → B1/B2/B3.
  - Prefer partitions with a clear discriminating observation.
  - Use *logically valid* partitions:
    - cover the space well enough that the true cause must be in one bucket (no "holes")
    - allow some overlap in practice (both can be true), but still be useful for elimination
    - if overlap is likely, add an explicit "both / interaction" or "other / unknown" bucket
  - Examples:
    - **Location**: server-side vs client-side vs integration/contract mismatch
    - **Call boundary**: bug is in this function vs in a function it calls (or in the contract between them)
    - **Timing**: ordering/race vs stale state/caching vs deterministic logic bug
    - **Data**: bad input vs transformation bug vs persistence/serialization bug

Partition quality bar:
- A possibility-space partition must list 2-4 plausible causes. "X vs not X" is not acceptable unless the "not X" bucket is further partitioned into concrete alternatives.
- Partitions must be phrased so evidence can actually eliminate buckets (no hand-wavy buckets).

- **Minimal working implementation → move toward real until it breaks**
  - Start with a small implementation that works.
  - Change one dimension at a time toward the real implementation.
  - Identify the first change that introduces the issue.

- **Bisection**
  - Use when you can define an approximate notion of "distance" and systematically move in ~half-steps rather than making tiny one-at-a-time changes.
  - Preferred: a deterministic reproducer (unit test / small harness) so each iteration is cheap.
  - When using a git-based bisection workflow (temporary branch), read `Guides/Core/debugging-tactic-code-bisection.md` before starting.

- **Minimal harness**
  - Create a deterministic reproducer (unit test, small harness, or minimal sample) so experiments are cheap.
  - Recipe (high-level):
    1. Pick the smallest surface area that still exhibits the symptom.
    2. Freeze inputs and eliminate external dependencies.
    3. Make the run fast and deterministic.
    4. Use it as the experiment runner for subsequent tactics (logging, bisection, invariants).

- **Prior-art research**
  - Use only after the possibility space is narrowed to a specific library/framework/component or a clear error signature.
  - Output contract: summarize 2-3 candidate explanations and map each to a discriminating experiment in this codebase (do not jump to fixes).

- **Invariants & assertions**
  - Define what must be true; add temporary asserts/guards to fail at the first invalid state.

## Testing a hypothesis is not applying a fix

Testing a hypothesis means running a discriminating experiment (logging, bisection, unit-test repro, minimal harness, etc.).

It does NOT mean "implement the fix and see if it helps."

Inspection-only exception (narrow):
- Only treat something as "obvious by inspection" when you can point to a specific, local code fact that directly implies incorrect behavior (e.g., typo, wrong variable used, off-by-one, missing guard).
- If the proposed change is non-local, architectural, or depends on runtime behavior, it is not "obvious by inspection" -- require evidence first.

## Investigation loop (logging-heavy default)

1. **Observe the symptom**: actual vs expected.
2. **Form a hypothesis**: keep it tentative.
3. **Collect evidence**: often via the Facts-first logging tactic.
4. **Wait for evidence**: the human runs and provides output.
5. **State facts**: report what the evidence shows.
6. **Repeat** until the root cause statement is isolated.

### Root cause (definition + hard gate)

"Root cause" means the most specific, testable statement that explains the observed symptom and is supported by discriminating evidence (or direct code proof for truly local inspection-only bugs).

Do not declare a root cause prematurely:
- A top-level partition bucket (or a chosen path through the possibility space) is not a root cause if it can be further partitioned into multiple plausible sub-causes.
- Before declaring "this bucket/path is the root cause" or "this bucket/path cannot be partitioned further", inspect the relevant code within the current best-explanation path and attempt at least one further partition based on concrete code structure/branches/contracts.
- If the current best explanation is still a category ("it's in module X", "it's caching", "it's concurrency"), STOP and propose the next partition or the smallest experiment that will partition it further.

Checkpoint: STOP and get explicit approval before declaring a root cause or applying a fix (use the standard gate line; see `Guides/Core/process-flow.md`).

## Log hygiene

- Remove or disable temporary logs once an experiment is complete and the hypothesis is eliminated.
- If a temporary log remains useful for the next iteration, keep it, but keep the set small and hypothesis-focused.
- Avoid log spam: prefer logging state changes, not every read.

## Stop conditions (consult human)

Stop and consult the human when:
- Expected behavior is ambiguous (product intent required).
- Required evidence is missing (human hasn't provided output needed to proceed).
- The next change is large/destructive/wide-reaching.
- You've iterated without gaining discriminating evidence.

If progress stalls:
- STOP and ask the human for a direction change (e.g., choose a different tactic, broaden/narrow the possibility space, provide missing evidence, or accept a workaround).
- This stop condition applies even in `auto`.

## Adapter notes (minimal)

Adapters should only cover:
- Logging APIs and how to capture/share evidence for a stack
- Known tooling limitations that affect evidence collection
