# Unit Test Infrastructure Guide

## Purpose

Defines the process for identifying, implementing, and compiling test infrastructure.

**Infrastructure includes:**
- Production code abstractions (protocols/wrappers for testability)
- Test doubles (stubs implementing protocols)
- Test data (fixtures)
- Test framework utilities (shared helpers)

## Gates

Core rule: every time the agent is waiting on the human, the message must end with a `⏳ GATE:` line. The only normal exception is full workflow completion, which uses `🏁 Complete. Let me know if anything needs adjustment.`

**Gate persistence.** Once a `⏳ GATE:` line is emitted, every subsequent response — including discussion, clarifications, and refinements — must end with the *same* gate line, verbatim, until the gate actually moves. The gate stays "on" between turns; re-emitting it is mandatory, not optional. Update the line only when the gate's content actually changes (e.g., a blocker emerges, or `Next` has to be revised); when updating, emit the new line in full at the end of that response. Do not paraphrase, shorten, or silently mutate the line across turns.

**No fabricated gates.** `⏳ GATE:` lines only appear at gates this `## Gates` section defines or at a properly emitted blocked gate. Do not invent new gate categories or labels to describe discussion state, partial completion, or intermediate review. If a `⏳ GATE:` line is needed that this guide doesn't define, that's a signal the guide is missing a gate — file it as a process improvement.

Use these standard gate lines:
- Planned gate: `⏳ GATE: Next: <what happens after your response>. Say "next" or what to change.`
- Blocked gate: `⏳ GATE: Blocked: <reason>. Resolve and say "next" to continue.`

Planned gates are the expected review points of this workflow. At each planned gate:
1. Summarize what was completed and what should happen next.
2. End with the planned gate line.
3. STOP and wait for the human.

In the planned gate line, `<what happens after your response>` should describe what the agent will do after the human gives advance intent.

If an unexpected blocker prevents continued work, use the blocked gate line and STOP until the human resolves it.

When the workflow finishes, return control to the parent testing workflow.

Planned gates for this workflow:
- After Phase 1 (Identify), to review the infrastructure analysis and branch the workflow.
- After Phase 3 (Compile), to review compilation results and what infrastructure changed.

---

## Advance intent

Advance intent moves past the current gate. Common signals: "next", "continue", "go ahead", "do it".

Rules:
- Recognized as approval to move past a gate only after you output a `⏳ GATE:` line.
- "we should...", "let's..." = discussion/context-setting, NOT authorization.
- Outside a gate, interpret "begin"/"next"/"continue" using the active phase rules below. Do not use them to create or check infrastructure phase markers early.

Progress tracking:
- Default marker convention: `- [ ]` / `- [x]` in the infrastructure work document (process artifact). See `Guides/Core/process-flow.md`, "Progress markers".
- Default rule: a `- [ ]` phase item means TODO or pending approval. Do not check the box without human approval.
- This workflow has a conditional marker model:
  - If Phase 1 concludes no infrastructure changes are required, do not create an infrastructure work document and do not invent phase items.
  - If Phase 1 concludes infrastructure changes are required, the infrastructure work document owns the phase items:
    - `- [ ] Phase 1: Identify`
    - `- [ ] Phase 2: Implement`
    - `- [ ] Phase 3: Compile`
- When a work document exists:
  - STOP at the Phase 1 gate with `- [ ] Phase 1: Identify` still unchecked.
  - Only after advance intent may the agent check `Phase 1: Identify` and begin Phase 2.
  - After Phase 3 completes, STOP at the planned gate with `Phase 2: Implement` and `Phase 3: Compile` still unchecked.
  - Only after advance intent may the agent check the remaining infrastructure phase items and return control to the parent testing workflow.
- If work stops due to ambiguity or an unexpected implementation/compile blocker, do not check the current infrastructure phase item.

**Behavior:** Context determines the action:
- If waiting at the Phase 1 gate → branch based on the approved analysis
- If waiting at the Phase 3 gate → check approved infrastructure phase items and return control to the parent testing workflow
- If stopped due to ambiguities or unexpected challenges → resume where you left off

---

## Process Overview

**Scope:** Infrastructure covers **all planned tests in the current testing session** (not one suite at a time, and not one section at a time). This ensures shared stubs, fixtures, and production code abstractions are identified holistically before writing begins.

**Three phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Identify** - Research and document infrastructure needs for all planned tests in the session
2. **Phase 2: Implement** - Create the infrastructure (if needed)
3. **Phase 3: Compile** - Ensure everything builds (if implemented)

**Progress tracking (only if infrastructure changes are required):** Infrastructure work document checklist uses `- [ ]` items for phases (process artifact convention).

**Flow:**
1. Phase 1 (Identify) → planned gate
2. Advance intent → **Branching (based on the Phase 1 conclusion):**
   - If **no infrastructure changes required** → infrastructure process complete (no document created)
   - If **infrastructure changes required** → Create work document (includes Phase 1/2/3 `- [ ]` checklist) → Execute Phase 2 (Implement)
3. After Phase 2 → Execute Phase 3 (Compile)
4. After Phase 3 → planned gate → on advance intent, check remaining infrastructure phase items and return to the parent testing workflow

**Possible outcomes:**
- No infrastructure changes required → complete after the Phase 1 gate (no document)
- Infrastructure changes required → complete after the Phase 3 gate (document tracks work)

---

## Phases

### Phase 1: Identify

**Goal:** Determine exactly what infrastructure is needed for all planned tests in the session

**Gate:** STOP after this phase and wait for approval / advance intent.

### Phase 2: Implement

**Runs only if:** Infrastructure changes needed (determined in Phase 1)

### Phase 3: Compile

**Runs only if:** Phase 2 ran

**Gate:** STOP after this phase and wait for advance intent.

---

## Phase 1: Identify

### Critical Mindset

**Your role is to enable tests, NOT decide whether to test:**

❌ **Wrong thinking:**
- "SSL pinning can't be unit tested, should we skip these tests?"
- "This requires too much refactoring, let's remove these tests"
- "This needs integration tests, not unit tests"

✅ **Correct thinking:**
- "SSL pinning requires abstracting certificate validation. Here are 3 approaches..."
- "Testing this requires refactoring ProductionClass to inject DependencyX. Here's the proposed change..."
- "Current architecture makes this hard to test. Should we: A) Add abstraction layer, or B) Refactor to dependency injection?"

**Always propose HOW to test, never whether to test.**

**During this phase, never skip a test because it requires a production code change.** If testing a component requires a protocol wrapper, dependency injection, or other production code abstraction, propose the minimal change as infrastructure and ask the human for approval.

---

### Process

**What to do:**

1. **START WITH STRATEGY**
   - Create "Overview / Strategy" section explaining the testing approach
   - Describe high-level plan before listing details

2. **SEARCH FIRST - MANDATORY**
   - **NEVER assume infrastructure exists**
   - Search the codebase to find relevant files and symbols
   - Open/read the relevant files to verify current capabilities
   - **Document what you searched and what you found (or did not find)**
   - If file not found: Mark as "NEW (does not exist)"
   - If file found: Mark as "Already exists at [path]" and list its current capabilities
   - **Before proposing any new test double, fixture, or helper:** search all test modules and shared test modules for existing equivalents. List what was found (or confirm nothing exists) in the work document before proposing new infrastructure.

3. **CHECK FOR EXISTING TESTS**
   - Review existing infrastructure already in use
   - Prefer reusing over creating new

4. **ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS**
   - What dependencies does the component inject?
   - Are there hard dependencies (like URLSession) that need abstraction?
   - What test data is needed?
   - Are there repetitive patterns for test framework?

5. **BE DEFINITIVE - NO ASSUMPTIONS**
   - Never say "new or existing" or "if available"
   - You must KNOW which it is through verified search
   - Every "Already exists" claim must be backed by evidence from your search + file inspection
   - **Every "NEW" must be backed by evidence that you did not find it**

6. **BE SPECIFIC**
   - For existing items: List exact new methods/properties needed
   - For new items: List exact API surface
   - Include file paths and current capabilities

7. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING**
   - Write analysis in work document
   - Organize by infrastructure category
   - **Include search commands and results in work document as proof**

**Then:**
- **If no infrastructure needed**: Document "No infrastructure changes required"
- **If infrastructure needed**: Document all needed changes

**Gate:** Present analysis and STOP with the planned gate line.

### Infrastructure Categories

#### 1. Production Code Abstractions

**Purpose:** Make production code testable

**Examples:**
- Protocol wrappers around Apple APIs (URLSession → NetworkSession)
- Dependency injection refactoring
- Certificate validation abstractions

**When needed:**
- Testing code with hard dependencies on frameworks
- Code that directly uses Apple APIs
- Code tightly coupled to specific implementations

#### 2. Test Doubles (Stubs)

**Purpose:** Implement protocols for dependency injection in tests

**Requirements:**
- Implement the protocol being stubbed
- Support controllable responses for async operations
- Provide tracking properties for verification (e.g., `var requests: [Request] = []`)
- Support flexible configuration for different test scenarios

**Location and Naming:**

See `skai/integration.md` for the project's test infrastructure locations and naming conventions.

**Naming Convention:**

Name test doubles based on their actual role:
- `*Stub` -- provides canned responses (e.g., `NetworkSessionStub` returns pre-configured results)
- `Mock*` -- verifies interaction expectations (e.g., `MockAnalyticsTracker` asserts that specific methods were called)

If existing test doubles in the module use incorrect terminology (e.g., a stub named `MockService`), propose renaming them to match the convention and get approval before proceeding.

#### 3. Fixtures

**Purpose:** Reusable test data

**Requirements:**
- Static properties on a struct
- Meaningful, realistic data
- Complete objects when possible

**Location and Naming:**

See `skai/integration.md` for the project's fixture locations and naming conventions.

#### 4. Test Framework Utilities

**Purpose:** Shared testing helpers that reduce boilerplate

**Requirements:**
- Only depends on Core module
- Well-documented with usage examples
- Generic and flexible where appropriate

**Location and Examples:**

See `skai/integration.md` for the project's test utility locations and available utilities.

**When to propose:**
- Pattern appears in multiple test suites
- Reduces significant boilerplate
- Enables consistent testing approach
- Solves a common testing problem

**Always propose to human before implementing.**

### Example: Good Infrastructure Analysis

````markdown
## Phase 1: Identify

### Overview / Strategy

To test `ComponentUnderTest` without making real external calls, we need to abstract 
third-party dependencies behind our own protocol that supports dependency injection.

**Approach**: Protocol Wrapper Pattern
- Create `ComponentProtocol` protocol that mirrors the third-party API we use
- Make the third-party type conform to it (production code continues using real implementation)
- Inject `ComponentProtocol` into `ComponentUnderTest` via dependency injection
- Create `ComponentStub` for tests with controllable responses

This allows us to control responses, simulate errors, and verify behavior without 
touching external dependencies.

---

### Production Code Abstractions

**Search performed:**
```bash
grep -r "protocol ComponentProtocol" path/to/source/
# Result: No matches found
```

**1. ComponentProtocol protocol** - **NEW (does not exist)**
- Location: `Module/Component/ComponentProtocol.swift`
- Purpose: Abstraction over third-party dependency to enable dependency injection
- Definition: `func operation(parameters: Parameters) async throws -> Result`

**2. ThirdPartyType extension** - **NEW**
- Same file as ComponentProtocol
- Purpose: Make real third-party type conform so production code works unchanged
- Empty conformance: `extension ThirdPartyType: ComponentProtocol {}`

**3. ComponentUnderTest** - **Modify existing** at `Module/Component/Component.swift`
- Current (line 82): `let dependency = ThirdPartyType(configuration: .default)`
- Add: `@Injected(\.componentDependency) var componentDependency` property
- Use injected dependency instead of creating new one
- Add Factory registration returning default implementation

### Stubs

**Search performed:**
```bash
glob_file_search "**/ComponentStub.swift"
# Result: No files found
```

**1. ComponentStub** - **NEW (does not exist)**
- Location: `Module/PreviewContent/Stubs/ComponentStub.swift`
- Conforms to: `ComponentProtocol` protocol
- Required API:
  - `func operation(parameters: Parameters) async throws -> Result`
  - `var calls: [Parameters] { get }` - tracks all calls made
  - Properties/methods to configure responses for testing

**Search performed:**
```bash
read_file path/to/Mocks/MockService.swift
# Found at specified path
```

**2. MockService** - **Already exists** at `path/to/Mocks/MockService.swift`
- ✅ Has: `state` publisher, `performAction()` method
- ➕ Need to add: tracking properties for retry attempts to support retry flow tests

### Fixtures

**1. Entity fixtures** - **NEW** (test-only helper)
- Location: In test file Constants section or `Module/PreviewContent/Fixtures/EntityFixtures.swift`
- Purpose: Pre-configured entities for testing
- Example: `static let valid = Entity(id: "test-id-123")`

**2. TestRequest** - **NEW** (test-only helper)
- Location: In test file Constants section
- Simple Request implementation for testing
- Uses codable `TestResponse` struct

### Test framework

- **No new utilities needed** - will use existing shared test utilities

---

### Summary

**Infrastructure needed:**
- 1 new protocol (ComponentProtocol)
- 1 protocol conformance (ThirdPartyType)
- 1 modified production class (ComponentUnderTest)
- 1 new stub (ComponentStub)
- 1 modified mock (MockService - add tracking properties)
- 2 new test helpers (EntityFixtures, TestRequest in test file)

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2?**

**Gate:** Present complete analysis and STOP with the planned gate line.

**After approval / advance intent:**
- If a work document was created: check the box on `Phase 1: Identify` (`- [x]`) in the work document.
- If infrastructure needed: Proceed to Phase 2.
- If no infrastructure needed: Infrastructure process complete (no Phase 2/3 work document required).
````

---

## Phase 2: Implement

**This phase only runs if infrastructure changes are needed.**

**Triggered by:** Advance intent after Phase 1 approval (when infrastructure changes are required)

### Process

**What to do:**

**0. Create work document** (per `Guides/Core/working-doc-conventions.md`):
   - **Session name**: `<session-name>` (the parent unit-testing workflow's session name)
   - **Subpath**: `testing`
   - **File name**: `infrastructure.md`
   - **Full path**: `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<session-name>/testing/infrastructure.md`
   - **Example**: `skai/working-docs/work/feature-branch/login-tests/testing/infrastructure.md`
   - **Structure**:
     ```markdown
     # Unit Testing - Infrastructure
     
     ## Context
     This document tracks the infrastructure work for implementing unit tests for [session scope].
     
     **Scope:** [test files / source files covered by this testing session]
     
     ## Checklist
     
     - [x] Phase 1: Identify
     - [ ] Phase 2: Implement
     - [ ] Phase 3: Compile
     
     ## Phase 1: Identify
     
     [Copy analysis from Phase 1 output]
     
     ## Phase 2: Implement
     
     [Implementation details will go here]
     ```

**1. Create infrastructure work spec** (if complex, otherwise implement directly):
   - **Full path**: `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<session-name>/testing/infrastructure-spec.md`
   - **Example**: `skai/working-docs/work/feature-branch/login-tests/testing/infrastructure-spec.md`
   - **Structure**: Motivation, Functional Requirements, Relevant Files, Task List
   - **Content**: Describe all stubs, mocks, fixtures, and production code changes needed
   - **No code**: Describe what to implement, not how

2. **Document in work document** what infrastructure was created

3. **Work through the spec with human:**
   - Human will say "Start task N" or "Proceed to next task"
   - Implement each task following the project's code organization policy (stack-specific)
   - Continue until all infrastructure tasks are complete

4. **Proceed to Phase 3** (Compile)

### Infrastructure Locations

See `skai/integration.md` for:
- Stub/mock locations and naming
- Fixture locations and naming
- Test utility locations
- Production code abstraction guidelines

---

## Phase 3: Compile

**This phase only runs if infrastructure was implemented in Phase 2.**

### Process

**What to do:**

1. **Create "Compilation" subsection** in work document under infrastructure section

2. **Run the build command** to compile the framework target
   
   See `skai/integration.md` for project-specific build commands.

3. **Document compilation results** in work document

4. **If there are errors:**
   - List all compilation errors
   - Fix them
   - Re-run compilation
   - Repeat until clean

5. **If no errors:** Document success with exit code 0

6. **Complete:** Infrastructure ready for use. STOP at the planned gate.

---

## Stub Implementation Guidelines

### Structure

```swift
import Testing  // For test doubles used in Swift Testing tests

public class ComponentStub: ComponentProtocol {
    // MARK: - ComponentProtocol
    
    public func operation(parameters: Parameters) async throws -> Result {
        calls.append(parameters)
        return try await nextResponse()
    }
    
    // MARK: - API
    
    // Public properties for test configuration and verification
    
    // MARK: - Variables
    
    public private(set) var calls: [Parameters] = []
    public var responses: [Result] = []
    private var responseIndex = 0
    
    // MARK: - Lifecycle
    
    public init() {}
    
    // MARK: - Helpers
    
    private func nextResponse() async throws -> Result {
        defer { responseIndex += 1 }
        return responses[responseIndex]
    }
}
```

### Key Principles

- **Track all interactions**: Store parameters in arrays for verification
- **Support controllable responses**: Allow tests to configure results and errors
- **Public configuration**: Allow tests to configure behavior
- **Thread-safe if needed**: Use `actor` for concurrent access
- **Follow code-organization**: Protocol conformance first, then API, then internal

---

## Fixture Implementation Guidelines

### Structure

```swift
import Foundation

public struct EntityFixtures {
    public static let valid = Entity(
        id: "entity-123",
        name: "Valid Entity",
        createdDate: Date(),
        owner: "Owner Name",
        status: .active
    )
    
    public static let inactive = Entity(
        id: "entity-456",
        name: "Inactive Entity",
        createdDate: Date(),
        owner: "Another Owner",
        status: .inactive
    )
}
```

### Key Principles

- **Static properties**: Easy to access in tests
- **Meaningful data**: Realistic and complete
- **Multiple variants**: Different scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases)
- **Reusable**: Useful across multiple test suites

---

## Common Patterns

### Protocol Wrapper Pattern

**Problem:** Need to test code that uses Apple framework directly (URLSession, FileManager, etc.)

**Solution:**
1. Create protocol matching the API you need
2. Make framework type conform via extension
3. Inject protocol instead of concrete type
4. Create stub implementing protocol for tests

**Example:**
```swift
// 1. Protocol
protocol ComponentProtocol {
    func operation(parameters: Parameters) async throws -> Result
}

// 2. Conformance
extension ThirdPartyType: ComponentProtocol {}

// 3. Injection
class ComponentUnderTest {
    @Injected(\.componentDependency) var componentDependency
}

// 4. Stub
class ComponentStub: ComponentProtocol { /* ... */ }
```

### Controllable Async Responses Pattern

**Problem:** Need controllable async responses in tests

**Solution:** Configure stubs with queued responses

**Example:**
```swift
// Setup
let stubComponent = ComponentStub()
stubComponent.responses = [
    .success(firstResult),
    .success(secondResult),
    .failure(ComponentError.failure)
]

Container.shared.componentDependency.register { stubComponent }
let sut = ComponentUnderTest()

// Test
let result1 = try await sut.performOperation(params: params1)  // Gets first response
let result2 = try await sut.performOperation(params: params2)  // Gets second response
let result3 = try await sut.performOperation(params: params3)  // Gets third response (throws)
```
