# Maintenance retro checklist (LLM + human)

Use this after making changes to `skai` to ensure nothing was forgotten.

## Retro intent (read this first)

This retro is a **backstop for completeness**, not a git/diff report.

- Scope: the retro covers **everything that changed since the previous retro** (if any). If no prior retro was performed, cover everything changed in the current session.
- Do **not** do a detailed "what changed" writeup unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer scanning docs/templates/runbooks for **consistency and missing updates**.
- If you find a straightforward miss **inside this repo** (e.g., a stale path in `README.md`, a missing `CHANGELOG.md` bullet, a missing manifest entry), **fix it immediately** and continue scanning.
- The expected output is either:
  - a short list of **misses / follow-ups**, or
  - **"Retro complete; no misses found."**

## 1) Inventory (high level only)

- In 1-2 bullets: what you changed (e.g., "Integration template format", "runbook behavior", "new asset added").
- State whether it's **host-install-visible** (affects host repo installs) or internal only.

## 2) Required bookkeeping

- Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` reflects major user-visible changes. Review each change made since the last retro and verify it has a corresponding entry if user-visible.
  - Changelog is release notes: prefer multiple short bullets over a single mega-entry.
- Ensure `assets.manifest.json` is updated if you added/moved/renamed any installable asset or installer dependency (templates/sections/runbooks/policies).
- Ensure `README.md` is updated if needed:
  - Quick start prompts if any runbook paths changed
  - Usage section: ensure the workflow descriptions and phases match the updated guide checkpoint/gate behavior (and add/update any guide inventory section if your README has one).
  - Any new conventions/invariants developers need to know
- Ensure `maintain-skai.md` is updated if you changed invariants or introduced a new maintenance rule.

## 3) Integration doc architecture checks (common misses)

- If you changed Integration behavior:
  - `Templates/docs/skai/integration.md` still has a human-owned "Special instructions / overrides" section.
  - Stack-specific templates exist under `Templates/docs/skai/integration-sections/`.
  - Runbooks still describe how to merge/update/remove the managed blocks.
  - 🟡 is used only for true project-specific constants/mappings (not for variables or standard procedures).
  - Integration section templates are **integration-doc-ready** content (no 🟡 TODO lists; no installer/human instruction prose; include copy/pasteable CLI templates with `<...>` variables).

## 4) Installer safety checks

- Runbooks still enforce:
  - discover → classify → plan → confirm → execute
  - permission-gated deletion/replacement of legacy candidates
  - managed headers for generated files
  - managed symlinks by validated target path
  - managed blocks for project-owned files like ignore files / Integration doc

## 5) Consistency checks

- Search for stale paths (e.g. old install target directories) and update all occurrences.
- Ensure new files referenced by runbooks exist at those paths.
- README link check: when `README.md` references a file or directory within this repo, ensure it is a markdown link (clickable in the browser), not just a bare backticked path.
- If you added or substantially edited any files under `Guides/`:
  - Verify each changed/new guide has a managed header.
  - Verify it has a `## Checkpoints` section if it contains any STOP points/gates, and that it references `Guides/Core/process-flow.md`.
  - Search for terminology drift (e.g., "Next Command") and fix to "advance intent".
- If a new skill was added or changed: verify the skill template is a **thin wrapper** (just references to Guides), not a self-contained document with inline logic. All substantive instructions must live in a Guide under `Guides/`.
- Spot-check changed files for smart/curly quotes (`"` `"` `'` `'`) and Unicode dashes (en-dash, em-dash). All repo content must use ASCII equivalents (see `maintain-skai.md`, "Content rules"). If found, normalize them.

## 6) Process reflection

Reflect on the session since the last retro (or since session start). Consider:

- **Pattern violations**: Did you break an established convention? What cue did you miss, and what check would have caught it earlier?
- **Recurring friction**: Were there repeated failures (e.g., tooling issues, encoding problems, ambiguous instructions) that a process change could prevent?
- **Missing knowledge**: Did you lack context that a skill, rule, or documentation improvement would provide? Would a new skill or rule help future LLMs avoid the same mistake?
- **Documentation gaps**: Are there undocumented invariants, conventions, or patterns that you had to learn from human correction?
- **Human corrections**: Did the human have to point out something you should have caught yourself? What was the root cause -- a missing check, a missing convention, or a gap in your understanding of the system?

Output: 1-4 concrete suggestions (not vague observations). Each suggestion should name the specific file or artifact to create/update and what it should say. The human will decide which to act on.

If nothing stands out, say **"No process suggestions."**

## 7) Retro output (keep it short)

- Always start your message with a one-line declaration that the retro was performed:
  - `Maintenance retro: DONE`
- If you fixed misses during the retro: list what you fixed (1-6 bullets), then list any remaining follow-ups.
- If you found misses you did not fix (because they require human decision): list them as **actionable follow-ups** (1-6 bullets).
- If you found none: say **"Maintenance retro complete; no misses found."**
- Include process suggestions from step 6 (if any) as a separate **"Process suggestions"** section at the end.
