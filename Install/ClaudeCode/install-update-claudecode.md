# Claude Code adapter: install/update (LLM runbook)

Purpose: install/update `skai` into any repo using Claude Code (standalone app, Mac app, terminal, or alongside any IDE).

This adapter is **stack-aware** (Xcode/Swift, Android/Kotlin, etc.). It detects the project stack from repo signals, then applies stack-specific guidance from addenda files.

## Assumptions (stop if false)

Assume the following, unless the host repo already establishes a different working convention:

- Claude instructions file is rooted at either `CLAUDE.md` or `claude.md` (prefer existing; default to `CLAUDE.md`).
- Claude ignore file is `.claudeignore`.
- Agent-facing skills live at `.claude/skills/skai-*/` (managed skill wrappers pointing to submodule sources).
- Mixed-agent repos may also contain `.cursor/**`; Claude sessions should ignore Cursor-specific assets by default.

If any assumption is false in the host repo's setup, STOP and ask the human what file/path/convention to use.

## Inputs (required reading)

- `assets.manifest.json`
- `Install/managed-header.md`
- `Install/conflict-precedence-policy.md`
- `Policies/safe-operations.md`
- `Policies/universal-stop-conditions.md`
- `Templates/docs/skai/integration.md`

## Migration-capable algorithm (required)

Follow the discover → classify → plan → confirm → execute workflow.

### 1) Discover (read-only)

- Identify whether `skai` is already present as a submodule (and where).
- If this is an update, record the current submodule commit SHA (pre-update) and the intended new SHA (post-update).
- **Detect stack** from project signals:
  - Xcode/Swift: `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, `*.swift`
  - Android/Kotlin: `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `*.kt`, `*.kts`
  - Otherwise: generic (no stack addendum needed)
  - Confirm the detected stack with the developer.
- **Detect IDE context** (for coexistence rules):
  - Note whether `.cursor/` exists (for `.claudeignore` setup).
  - Note whether `.cursorignore` exists (for proposing `.claude/**` exclusion).
  - Do **not** inventory or classify other IDEs' contents — those belong to other adapters and are out of scope.
- Inventory existing install artifacts:
  - Claude instruction files (`claude.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/**`)
  - `docs/**`
  - the known legacy and canonical SKAI project-artifact paths in `Install/conflict-precedence-policy.md`
- Identify any existing docs containing integration details (to migrate into Integration doc).

### 2) Classify

Classify each discovered artifact:
- **Managed**: has the managed header (`Managed-By: skai`) → safe to overwrite.
- **Managed symlink**: a symlink that points into `Submodules/skai/...` at the expected target path → safe to replace/update.
- **Legacy candidate**: looks like a managed asset but lacks the header → do not overwrite.
- **Project-owned**: custom → do not overwrite.

### 3) Plan (no changes yet)

Prepare a concrete plan:
- Files to create
- Files to update (managed only, including managed symlinks)
- Legacy candidates to supersede (create new canonical outputs)
- Integration doc migration items
- Canonical SKAI project-artifact path migrations and any destination conflicts
- Legacy cleanup proposals (permission-gated)
- Legacy adapter migration (see "Migrating from old adapter IDs" below)

### 4) Confirm (human gate)

Present the plan and wait for human approval before writing.

If updating the submodule, include an "update review" section:
- Summarize changes between the old SHA and new SHA for relevant paths:
  - `Guides/`, `Policies/`, `Templates/`, `Install/`, `assets.manifest.json`, `README.md`
- If you cannot compute the diff yourself, STOP and ask the human to provide the diff output.

### 5) Execute (safe order)

1. Ensure submodule is present/updated.
2. Perform the approved canonical project-artifact path migrations from `Install/conflict-precedence-policy.md`; STOP on any source/destination collision.
3. Create/update `skai/integration.md` (migrate legacy command docs into it; do not delete legacy docs by default).
   - If you cannot find the required integration information in-repo:
     - Create/seed the Integration doc from `Templates/docs/skai/integration.md`.
     - Fill only what you can source with high confidence.
     - Add explicit 🟡 placeholders for missing items.
     - STOP and ask the human for the missing items before proceeding.
   - Prefer non-interactive command-line commands over GUI instructions. If you can't produce command-line commands with high confidence, leave 🟡 placeholders and ask.
   - **Stack-specific integration doc guidance**: if a stack was detected, read the corresponding addendum for additional rules:
     - Xcode/Swift → `Install/ClaudeCode/stack-xcode.md`
     - Android/Kotlin → `Install/ClaudeCode/stack-android.md`
   - Follow `Install/integration-doc-install-update.md` for how to update the Integration doc safely (managed blocks + human overrides).
4. Create/update the Claude instruction file (`claude.md` vs `CLAUDE.md`) using managed headers.
5. Install Claude Code skills into `.claude/skills/` (see "Installing Claude Code skills" below).
6. Create/update ignore files (permission-gated if they already exist and are project-owned):
   - Update `.gitignore` by inserting/updating a managed block:
     - Add `skai/working-docs/` so ephemeral working documents are not committed.
   - Update `.claudeignore` by inserting/updating a managed block:
     - Exclude `.cursor/**` so Claude sessions don't ingest Cursor-specific assets by default.
     - Do NOT exclude `Submodules/skai/**` here; use editor UI excludes for autocomplete/search clutter instead.
   - If `.cursorignore` exists, propose inserting/updating an equivalent managed block to exclude `.claude/**` (ask approval before changing).
7. Optionally propose cleanup of legacy candidates as a separate explicit step.
8. Write/update `skai/install-state.json` (see "Install state file" below).

Required Integration doc fields to request (minimum set):
- Build/compile command(s)
- Unit test command(s): run all + run a single test/subset
- How to capture full output (paths/artifacts the human should paste back)
- Device/simulator/emulator conventions (if applicable)
- Known evidence-capture limitations (if any)

## Installing Claude Code skills (no symlinks)

Create these skills in the host repo under `.claude/skills/` by copying the shared templates from the submodule and inserting the managed marker comment immediately after the YAML frontmatter (see `Install/managed-header.md`).

Use `Managed-Adapter: claude-code` and `Managed-Id: skill.<skill-name>` (e.g., `skill.skai-debugging`).

Rules:
- Each destination `SKILL.md` is considered managed only if it contains the managed marker comment described in `Install/managed-header.md`.
- Overwrite only if destination is missing or already contains the managed marker.

Install these skills:
- `.claude/skills/skai-debugging/SKILL.md`
  - source: `Submodules/skai/Templates/skills/skai-debugging/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/skai-work-spec-creation/SKILL.md`

## Install state file

After a successful install or update, write/update `skai/install-state.json` so the `update-installation` skill can detect changes and re-run the appropriate adapters.

Format:

```json
{
  "managedBy": "skai",
  "submodulePath": "Submodules/skai",
  "lastSHA": "<current submodule HEAD SHA>",
  "lastRelease": "<v<N> release tag at submodule HEAD, or null if not on a release>",
  "lastUpdatedAt": "<yyyy-mm-dd>",
  "installedAdapters": [
    {
      "adapter": "<adapter-id>",
      "runbook": "<submodule-relative runbook path>",
      "lastRunAt": "<yyyy-mm-dd>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- If the file does not exist, create it with this adapter's entry.
- If the file already exists, **merge**: update `lastSHA`, `lastRelease`, `lastUpdatedAt`, and upsert this adapter's entry in `installedAdapters` (preserve entries from other adapters).
- Determine `lastRelease` from the submodule's current HEAD: `git -C <submodulePath> tag --points-at HEAD --list 'v*'` -- if a `v<N>` tag points at HEAD, use the highest; otherwise set `lastRelease` to null.
- The adapter ID for this runbook is `claude-code`; the runbook path is `Install/ClaudeCode/install-update-claudecode.md`.

## Migrating from old adapter IDs

Previous versions of `skai` used IDE-specific adapter IDs for Claude Code installations: `jetbrains-claudecode`, `xcode-claudecode`, `androidstudio-claudecode`. These have been consolidated into the single `claude-code` adapter.

During discovery, if `install-state.json` contains any of the old adapter IDs:
- Replace the old entry with a single `claude-code` entry.
- Use the current date as `lastRunAt`.
- Include this migration in the plan presented at the confirm gate.

## Legacy artifact cleanup (permission-gated)

During discovery, if you find artifacts that appear to be from older installations (symlinks pointing into the submodule, guide copies without managed headers, skills that have been renamed or replaced), propose a cleanup plan:

- **Managed symlinks** (symlinks into `Submodules/skai/...`): safe to delete (installer-created artifacts, no approval needed). Remove the containing directory if empty after cleanup.
- **Non-symlink or project-authored content**: treat as project-owned and STOP to ask the human what to do.
