# SKAI: Maintenance retro

## Instructions

- Read `internal/maintain-retro.md` and follow it.
- Fix straightforward misses in-repo immediately (stale paths, missing changelog bullets, missing manifest entries), then output only:
  - what you fixed and any remaining follow-ups, or
  - "Maintenance retro complete; no misses found."
