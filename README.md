# `skai`

Reusable, mostly IDE-agnostic **agentic coding guides** and **policies** you can vendor into any repo.

This repo is designed to be installed as a **git submodule** and activated by an **LLM-runbook-driven installer** that:
- inspects the host repo (including legacy installs),
- proposes a migration plan,
- writes **managed files** only (safe updates),
- installs agent-facing assets into the host repo's expected directories (IDE/agent-specific),
- generates IDE-specific artifacts (e.g., Cursor `.mdc`) into the host repo.
- updates agent ignore files using managed blocks so multi-agent installs can coexist cleanly (permission-gated if the ignore files already exist).

Recommended host locations for agent-facing docs:
- Cursor: `.cursor/skills/skai-*/`
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/skai-*/`
- Codex: `.agents/skills/skai-*/`

## Quick start (recommended)

### 1) Add the submodule (one-time)

From your host repo root:

```bash
git submodule add <REPO_URL> Submodules/skai
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you already have the submodule installed, just run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2) Ask your agent to install/update (copy/paste)

Paste ONE of these prompts into your agent chat (from the host repo root).

#### Cursor prompt

> Install/update `skai` in this repo by following `Submodules/skai/Install/Cursor/install-update-cursor.md` ([`Install/Cursor/install-update-cursor.md`](Install/Cursor/install-update-cursor.md)).
>
> - If the `Submodules/skai` submodule is missing, add it there.
> - Do a discovery pass first, then propose a migration plan, then WAIT for approval before writing.
> - Use `skai/integration.md` ([`skai/integration.md`](skai/integration.md)) as the project-owned Integration doc and migrate any legacy build/test command notes into it (do not delete legacy files unless I explicitly approve).
> - Only overwrite files that contain the managed header (`Managed-By: skai`). Treat lookalike files without the header as legacy candidates.

#### Claude Code prompt

> Install/update `skai` in this repo by following `Submodules/skai/Install/ClaudeCode/install-update-claudecode.md` ([`Install/ClaudeCode/install-update-claudecode.md`](Install/ClaudeCode/install-update-claudecode.md)).
>
> - If the `Submodules/skai` submodule is missing, add it there.
> - Do a discovery pass first, then propose a migration plan, then WAIT for approval before writing.
> - Use `skai/integration.md` ([`skai/integration.md`](skai/integration.md)) as the project-owned Integration doc and migrate any legacy build/test command notes into it (do not delete legacy files unless I explicitly approve).
> - Only overwrite files that contain the managed header (`Managed-By: skai`). Treat lookalike files without the header as legacy candidates.

#### Codex prompt

> Install/update `skai` in this repo by following `Submodules/skai/Install/Codex/install-update-codex.md` ([`Install/Codex/install-update-codex.md`](Install/Codex/install-update-codex.md)).
>
> - If the `Submodules/skai` submodule is missing, add it there.
> - Do a discovery pass first, then propose a migration plan, then WAIT for approval before writing.
> - Use `skai/integration.md` ([`skai/integration.md`](skai/integration.md)) as the project-owned Integration doc and migrate any legacy build/test command notes into it (do not delete legacy files unless I explicitly approve).
> - Use `.agents/AGENTS.md` as the Codex instruction file.
> - Only overwrite files that contain the managed header (`Managed-By: skai`). Treat lookalike files without the header as legacy candidates.

These runbooks work with any IDE (JetBrains, Xcode, Android Studio, VS Code, etc.) or standalone agent environment. Stack-aware runbooks auto-detect the project stack and apply the appropriate guidance.

### 3) Set up a GitHub MCP server (optional)

Some workflows (process improvement ticket filing, ticket implementation) require a GitHub MCP server to create and manage GitHub issues. If you don't need these workflows, skip this step.

Add a GitHub MCP server to your IDE's MCP configuration with a personal access token that has repo issue permissions. The JSON format is the same across IDEs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Config file locations:**
- Cursor: `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-level) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)
- Claude Code: `~/.claude.json`
- Codex: use the MCP configuration location supported by your Codex environment.

## How installs stay safe

- **Integration doc (project-owned)**: [`skai/integration.md`](skai/integration.md) is the single source of truth for project-specific commands/paths (build/test/lint/etc). Templates live in [`Templates/`](Templates/).
- **Managed files**: host-project files written by the installer have a required header (see [`Install/managed-header.md`](Install/managed-header.md)). The installer overwrites only files that already contain this header.
- **Legacy installs**: lookalike files without the header are treated as **legacy candidates** and are not overwritten by default (see [`Install/conflict-precedence-policy.md`](Install/conflict-precedence-policy.md)).

## Integration document (how to use it)

The Integration doc ([`skai/integration.md`](skai/integration.md)) is the **project-owned** place where `skai` workflows get the concrete, copy/pasteable details they need to run deterministically (build/test commands, destinations, artifact paths, evidence expectations).

Why it matters:
- It prevents agents from guessing project-specific constants (like `xcodebuild -destination` strings, scheme/test plan conventions, or where `.xcresult` / logs are stored).
- It makes install/update migrations safe: the installer can preserve your filled values while updating the managed template structure around them.

How humans should fill it:
- **🟡 means "required project-specific value is missing."**
- Under a 🟡 item you may see one or more `INSTRUCTION:` lines. Those are **not part of the long-term document**; they exist only to explain what to fill in.
- When you fill a value:
  - remove the 🟡 marker
  - delete the `INSTRUCTION:` line(s) under it
- If a future install/update can't infer a required value with high confidence, the installer may **restore** 🟡 + `INSTRUCTION:` prompts so the doc remains a complete, reliable source of truth.

> **Note on `🟡`:** The Integration doc's `🟡` (missing project-specific value) is a separate concept from the workflow-progress `🟡` used in source files by skai workflows (see [Agent note-taking and progress tracking](#how-all-workflows-work) below). Both share the emoji; their lifecycles differ.

## IDE clutter / autocomplete (recommended)

To reduce duplicate autocomplete/search results (submodule sources + installed assets), hide the submodule in your editor UI while keeping the submodule [`README.md`](README.md) visible.

Example for Cursor/VS Code workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/Submodules/skai/**": true,
    "**/Submodules/skai/README.md": false
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/Submodules/skai/**": true,
    "**/Submodules/skai/README.md": false
  }
}
```

Android Studio (JetBrains):
- In the Project tool window, right-click `Submodules/skai` → **Mark Directory as** → **Excluded**.
- Optionally also exclude `.claude/skills/skai-*` or `.agents/skills/skai-*` if you don't want the skill install artifacts in search results.
- Prefer local IDE excludes over committing `.idea` changes unless your repo explicitly versions IDE config.

## Usage

After installation, workflows are available as **skills** that your agent activates automatically based on conversational context.

### How all workflows work

**Minimal command structure.** You don't need to memorize strict commands:

1. Start with context that activates a skill/workflow (e.g. "Write a work spec", "Start unit testing", "Start debugging").
2. Progress through steps using **advance intent** (e.g. "begin", "next", "continue", "go ahead").
3. At certain steps the agent will **stop and wait** at a checkpoint (gate). At checkpoints, the agent ends its output with exactly one of these lines:
   - `⏳ GATE: Next: <thing>. Say "next" or what to change.`
   - `⏳ GATE: Blocked: <reason>. Resolve and say "next" to continue.`
   - `🏁 Complete. Let me know if anything needs adjustment.` (not a gate -- workflow finished)
4. Saying "next" (or similar) at a checkpoint counts as approval to proceed.
5. Adding **"auto"** to advance intent tells the agent to proceed without stopping at checkpoints, unless a universal STOP condition applies (e.g. "next auto", "begin auto").
6. You can bound auto: **"auto to <milestone>"** means "proceed until you are about to begin the milestone, then stop" (e.g. "next auto to task 7").

**Agent note-taking and progress tracking.** The agent keeps structured notes so you can pick up where you left off. Two marker conventions coexist:

- In **process artifacts** (markdown workflow documents — work specs, planning docs, retro outputs, ticket drafts, etc.): the agent uses `- [ ]` / `- [x]` markdown checkboxes with stable letter-led IDs (`D1`, `T1`, `F1`, `S1`, etc.) on each item. Completion is checking the box — the artifact keeps a record of every resolved item.
- In **source files** (test code, application code) written or planned by a skai workflow: the agent uses a **🟡** emoji on lines/functions/sections that are TODO. Completion is *removal* of the marker — the file's remaining work is read by which 🟡s remain. The canonical example is the unit test planning workflow, where section MARKs and test functions are seeded with 🟡 and the markers come off as tests are implemented and pass.
- Markers are cleared only when items are resolved and you give approval at the relevant gate.

> **Note on `🟡`:** This is the workflow-progress `🟡`, distinct from the [Integration document](#integration-document-how-to-use-it) `🟡` (which marks missing project-specific values needing human input). Both share the emoji; their lifecycles differ.

**Retros on demand.** At any point you can ask the agent to **"retro"** to check for gaps, update documents, backfill requirements, and reflect on process.

### Work spec creation (skill `skai-work-spec-creation`)

Structured planning and specification for complex features. Produces a planning document (design decisions, API sketch), normalized product requirements, and a work specification (tasks, subtasks, requirements traceability).

- Guide [`Guides/Spec/work-spec-creation.md`](Guides/Spec/work-spec-creation.md)

**Prerequisites:** Discuss the feature or problem with the agent in some detail before initiating the process -- scope, motivating use cases, architecture, solution approaches. A thorough upfront discussion produces a much higher quality first draft and minimizes iteration. A Jira ticket, feature request, or problem statement is a good starting point.

**Phases:**

1. **Planning document + design discussion.** Agent summarizes the discussion into a document seeded with `- [ ] D<n> [Kind] <summary>` discussion items per topic (each `[Question]`, `[Proposal]`, or `[Tradeoff]`). Optional: for large efforts, the planning document can be organized into explicit phase sections; each phase runs its own mini-cycle (discussion, API sketch, requirements normalization, work spec) before moving to the next. While any `- [ ]` item remains unresolved the workflow is at a blocked gate; the moment they're all resolved (check the box, append a `- **Decision**` sub-bullet) the agent emits the first planned gate to advance to API sketch.
2. **API sketch.** Agent drafts the API surfaces implied by the design. Gate: human confirms the design is ready to proceed.
3. **Requirements normalization.** Agent promotes behaviors from the planning document into canonical requirements. Gate: human acknowledges requirements updates.
4. **Work spec first pass.** Agent writes top-level tasks only (no subtasks). Gate: human reviews the task list.
5. **Work spec second pass.** Agent adds subtasks, requirement IDs, and traceability mapping. Gate: human reviews the completed work spec.

### Work spec implementation (skill `skai-work-spec-implementation`)

Execute tasks from a completed work spec, one top-level task per cycle.

- Guide [`Guides/Spec/work-spec-implementation.md`](Guides/Spec/work-spec-implementation.md)

**Prerequisites:** A completed work spec.

**Phases (repeating):**

1. **Implement next top-level task.** Agent implements all subtasks under Task N. Gate: agent stops after finishing Task N and waits before moving to Task N+1.

### UI Map architecture (skill `skai-ui-map-architecture`)

Create or change the app's UI Map as an architecture artifact. Produces a change package under `skai/changes/<change-id>/` containing the architecture artifact, `proposed-ui-map.yaml`, and `proposed-ui-map.svg`; the official map stays frozen during architecture.

- Guide [`Guides/UIMap/ui-map-architecture.md`](Guides/UIMap/ui-map-architecture.md)
- Example [`Guides/UIMap/ui-map-demo.md`](Guides/UIMap/ui-map-demo.md) -- a complete UI Map in YAML with its rendered diagram

**Prerequisites:** Product/design/story inputs for a baseline map or scoped map change. Existing maps live at `skai/ui-map/ui-map.yaml`; architecture change artifacts live under `skai/changes/<change-id>/`.

**Phases:**

1. **Discussion.** Agent digests the inputs and drafts topic-organized map decisions with inline `- [ ]` items (questions, proposals, tradeoffs). Gate: human resolves each item before map changes are written.
2. **Map changes.** Agent translates the resolved decisions into typed map changes, writes the package's proposed map, and renders that proposal for validation and review. Ends with `🏁 Complete.` once the valid architecture package is in place.

### UI Map implementation (skill `skai-ui-map-implementation`)

Conform app code to the proposed map in an architecture change package, then promote that map to official. The guide covers the audit, alignment discussion, checkbox-tracked code changes and their ownership dispositions, placeholder scaffolding, build verification, and change requests back to architecture.

- Guide [`Guides/UIMap/ui-map-implementation.md`](Guides/UIMap/ui-map-implementation.md)

**Prerequisites:** A change package at `skai/changes/<change-id>/` (proposed map + render + architecture artifact) and the app codebase; with no change package, the official `skai/ui-map/ui-map.yaml` is the frozen target. Run mode (Plan vs Build) is inferred from context.

**Stages:**

1. **Audit.** Agent compares the codebase to the target map within the change's scope and separates UI-map-owned work, concrete handoffs, and map-level change requests.
2. **Discussion.** Agent resolves the non-mechanical decisions the audit raises. Gate: discussion complete.
3. **Code Changes.** Agent writes typed, unchecked items with stable IDs and a Disposition (`implement` / `placeholder` / `planned` / `handoff`), ending with a terminal promote item when a proposed map exists. The checkbox records completion; Disposition records ownership. Gate: Code Changes ready.
4. **Implement.** In Build, the agent executes owned items, build-verifies at chunk boundaries, and blocks while any handoff remains unchecked. In Plan, owned code work remains unchecked as `planned`. When a proposed map exists, promotion is the terminal item and runs only at the mode's completion point. Click-through QA is downstream, not a gate.

### Unit testing (skill `skai-unit-testing`)

Plan-first testing workflow. The agent creates an orchestration document for the overall testing session, plans all tests upfront, runs one infrastructure pass across all planned tests, and then implements tests one logical section at a time (e.g. "Success Tests", "Error Handling Tests"). Handles new test suites, additions to existing suites, and fixing failing tests.

- Guides [`Guides/Test/unit-testing-guide.md`](Guides/Test/unit-testing-guide.md), [`Guides/Test/unit-test-planning-guide.md`](Guides/Test/unit-test-planning-guide.md), [`Guides/Test/unit-test-infrastructure-guide.md`](Guides/Test/unit-test-infrastructure-guide.md), [`Guides/Test/unit-test-writing-guide.md`](Guides/Test/unit-test-writing-guide.md)

**Prerequisites:** Source code to test. Often triggered by a work spec task, but can be used independently.

**Phases:**

1. **Planning.** Agent chooses a session name for the current testing effort and creates `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<session-name>/testing/unit-testing.md` (following [`Guides/Core/working-doc-conventions.md`](Guides/Core/working-doc-conventions.md)) with a `- [ ] Planning` / `- [ ] Infrastructure` / `- [ ] Writing` checklist, and creates test files organized into sections with test stubs in each. Test files use `🟡` on section MARKs and `@Test` functions (in-code progress markers). Doc comments on every stub serve as the test plan. At the planning gate, `Planning` remains unchecked until the human approves advancing to infrastructure.
2. **Infrastructure.** Agent identifies required test infrastructure across all planned tests in the testing session (stubs, fixtures, production code abstractions) and proposes additions. The orchestration document keeps `Infrastructure` unchecked until the human approves advancing to writing. Related infrastructure docs and artifacts live under the same `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<session-name>/...` session folder.
3. **Writing** (per section, file-by-file). Agent implements tests and then runs them section-by-section, finishing the current file before moving to the next. Gates: agent stops after writing (before running tests), and stops after test results to confirm conclusions and next steps (including any proposed production-code fixes). As tests pass and the human approves, the agent removes `🟡` from those test functions and section MARKs in the test files. The orchestration document keeps `Writing` unchecked until all sections in the testing session are approved complete. If a test requires infrastructure that wasn't identified in Phase 2, it is skipped, the missing infrastructure is documented, and the human can decide at the next planned gate whether to re-enter the infrastructure phase or defer that skipped work.

Phase 3 repeats for each section until none remain.

### Debugging (skill `skai-debugging`)

Evidence-first problem resolution. Prevents "guessing fixes" loops by requiring observable evidence before drawing conclusions. The process defines a toolkit of effective strategies (targeted logging, possibility-space partitioning, minimal reproducers, bisection, invariant assertions) that guide the agent's debugging approach.

- Guides [`Guides/Core/debugging-guide.md`](Guides/Core/debugging-guide.md), [`Policies/debugging-process-rule.md`](Policies/debugging-process-rule.md)

**Prerequisites:** A bug, crash, or unexpected behavior to investigate. Provide whatever evidence you have (error messages, logs, screenshots, steps to reproduce).

**Phases (repeating):**

1. **Hypothesize and experiment.** Agent states the current possibility space, chooses a tactic, and proposes the smallest discriminating experiment. Gates: pre-experiment and post-experiment during iteration, then hard gates for root cause, fix, and verify/close.

Repeats until the root cause is isolated.

### Dev retro (skill `skai-dev-retro`)

Completeness backstop that can be used at any point during any workflow. Reviews what has transpired since the last retro (or since session start), identifies gaps, reconciles plan drift, updates documentation, backfills requirements, and reflects on process.

- Guide [`Guides/Process/dev-retro.md`](Guides/Process/dev-retro.md)

**Prerequisites:** Work to review. The agent reads work specs, planning docs, evidence artifacts, and requirements produced since the last retro.

**Phases:**

1. **Retro.** Agent performs the full checklist, reports findings, and completes immediately if no process suggestions were generated.
2. **Process improvement follow-up (optional).** If the retro identifies process improvements, agent lists them in the retro output as `- [ ] S<n>` items and stops at a handoff gate. On `next`, the agent enters [`Guides/Process/ticket-filing.md`](Guides/Process/ticket-filing.md), which drafts `process-tickets.md`, lets the human review/edit the resulting `- [ ] T<n> Ticket: ...` entries, and files the remaining ones on `next`.

### Process refinement (skill `skai-process-refinement`)

Hardens a process guide against a cold review. A fresh, no-context session reads the guide set and attacks it; the refining session triages the findings, repairs one cluster at a time, scores the round, and decides whether to run another.

- Guide [`Guides/Process/process-refinement-guide.md`](Guides/Process/process-refinement-guide.md)
- Template [`Guides/Process/cold-review-prompt-template.md`](Guides/Process/cold-review-prompt-template.md)

**Prerequisites:** The guide document(s) to refine, and a design spec to judge them against. Without a spec, close that gap first -- the spec is the standard every finding is weighed against.

**Phases:**

1. **Commission the review.** Fill the template's slots and hand the filled prompt to a fresh session. The reviewer must not see the refinement guide or the template itself -- both are refiner-facing and would bias it.
2. **Triage.** Classify every finding `accept` / `log only` / `reject` / `human decision` against the codification bar, consulting the target's findings log so settled ground is not relitigated. Collapse findings that name one defect into a single row.
3. **Score the round.** Before the first repair, record the round's score, defect counts, and noise count in the working document.
4. **Repair.** One cluster at a time, with a written self-check after each, then verify the repairs before handing the guide back.
5. **Stop or iterate.** Terminal is a fresh round over the current text with no new live findings, or the human approving the unimplemented ledger. Close the pass and append every disposition to the findings log.

### Suggestion (skill `skai-suggestion`)

The suggestion box for skai itself. A developer has an idea, request, or complaint about the skai dev process; the agent helps articulate it, captures it as a ticket draft, and optionally files it as a GitHub issue on the skai repo. It does not change any guide's content — that is [Process refinement](#process-refinement-skill-skai-process-refinement).

- Guide [`Guides/Process/ticket-filing.md`](Guides/Process/ticket-filing.md)

**Prerequisites:** None -- can be triggered at any point during a session.

**Phases:**

1. **Understand and draft.** Agent asks clarifying questions to understand the suggestion (skipped if the developer provides enough detail up front). Once it has enough context, it stops at a ready-to-draft gate. On `next`, it chooses a session name, writes one or more `- [ ] T<n> Ticket: ...` drafts (with bold sub-bullet body fields) to `skai/working-docs/<branch-path>/<session-name>/process-tickets.md`, and presents them for review.
2. **Review and file (optional).** The draft-review gate is the main filing gate: the human can revise drafts or move them to a `## Skipped` subsection, or say `next` to file the remaining unchecked `- [ ] T<n> Ticket: ...` entries as GitHub issues on `skai`. On filing, the entry is checked (`- [x]`) and a `- **Filed** #<n>` sub-bullet is appended.

### Update installation (skill `skai-update-installation`)

Update `skai` to the latest release (or a target you name), review what changed, and re-run adapter runbooks.

- Guide [`Guides/Core/update-installation-guide.md`](Guides/Core/update-installation-guide.md)

**Prerequisites:** An existing installation ([`skai/install-state.json`](skai/install-state.json) must exist from the initial install).

**Phases:**

1. **Pick target, update, and report.** Agent updates the submodule to the latest release (`v<N>` tag) by default — or to a target you name (head of current branch, head of main, or a specific commit) — and presents the `## Release <N>` notes between your installed and target releases. Gate: human acknowledges before any runbooks are re-run.
2. **Re-run adapters.** Agent re-runs each installed adapter's install/update runbook to pick up new or changed assets.

### Working documents

- Working documents (plans, specs, progress logs) live under [`skai/working-docs/`](skai/working-docs/) and are organized by your current git branch.
- `<branch-path>` is the current branch name, with `/` decomposed into nested folders (so `feature/foo` becomes `feature/foo/`).
- Working docs are ephemeral and typically git-ignored.
- One exception: the refinement **findings log** at [`skai/refinement-reviews/`](skai/refinement-reviews/) is committed, one file per refined target. It carries what earlier refinement passes decided, so a later pass does not re-argue settled ground.

## Development guide (for contributors)

This repo is typically maintained with an LLM. When you ask an LLM to make changes, point it at:
- [`README.md`](README.md) (this file)
- [`maintain-skai.md`](maintain-skai.md) (LLM maintainer runbook)
- [`maintain-retro.md`](maintain-retro.md) (post-change checklist to ensure nothing was forgotten)
- [`maintain-tickets.md`](maintain-tickets.md) (work through process improvement tickets labeled `agent ready`)

### LLM-assisted change workflow (recommended)

- Ask the LLM to:
  - propose a small plan,
  - make the minimal edits,
  - then report exactly which files changed and why.
- Require safety defaults (unless you explicitly override):
  - no commits
  - no deletions
  - no dependency changes

### Contributor rules

- Keep sources in this repo **IDE-neutral** (`.md`). IDE-specific outputs are generated into host repos by install/update runbooks.
- If you add/move/rename an asset, update:
  - [`assets.manifest.json`](assets.manifest.json)
  - [`README.md`](README.md) Usage section (developer-facing guides should be documented at file level)
- Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible changes.
- Do not introduce scripts that mutate host repos; installers are LLM-runbook-driven and must follow the safety policies in [`Policies/`](Policies/).
